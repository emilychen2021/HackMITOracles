# HackMIT 2020 Oracles

## Mission Statement

Mastery of concepts in higher education is difficult, particularly in vital yet academically competitive fields. This initiative for accomplishment is one that deserves to be appropriately addressed by providing an interface to connect “oracles” to these students, one which allows for productive and candid interactions.
